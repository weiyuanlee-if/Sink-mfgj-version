/* A game about a diaspora person returning to an island with many traumatic memories. An unemployed college student with an English degree, the death of his twin brother haunts him, he barely remembers anything from childhood, feeling like a drone.

His eccentric aunt passes away mysteriously after breaking contact with the family during his early teen years, without a reason as to why. His mother cannot attend the funeral due to an illness and he decides to go and meet up with a cousin, Luna, who he barely remembers, she claims the house is passed down to her and him. they spend their time cleaning up the house when he arrives so that he could finally sleep there before the funeral. He relearns his history and programming since his aunt was a software engineer and has some essays locked behind passwords.

The island are divided into two despite being one with two governments and there is a conspiracy that this one side of the island of mostly Black and Brown working class people are expected to fend for themselves during the next upcoming super storm. 

He is supposed to leave and comeback after the funeral and everyone is up in the air on whether to evacuate or prepare.  He spends most of his days (the game takes about two weeks) reading documents on his aunt laptop and with occassional visits from Luna where they usually spend the day looking at objects  water plants and visiting food places.

He then finds a mysterious plant that his aunt write about in her journal that never dies and he replanted it and has to water it every day to grow into something big and special. It is the plant that must be fed to the monster tht his twin brother has become, killing animals and hurting humans.

Eventually he suspects he's being stalked as he digs deeper into his grandmother's PC contents. The police are watching after him, everyone knows the child who has died under the flood and the arrest of his aunt and they wanna know why he's back.

They suspect he's continuing murders on the island, as femicidos have been rising, but ofc obvs he's not the murderer, there's someone else out there, its his twin monstrous brother, and they want to tke him down.'

The Alvarez family, stigmatized by the death of their youngest child and the murders that continued and are framed on the aunt has made her hide from the public eye.*/

<h1><i>Dawn</i></h1>

I look down at the rotting flower beds from the dormer window, breath in deep and push my hair back. Wooden boards moaning under my weight, 10 year old attic dust pluming in the air from when I <u>pulled off the curtains</u> (like Luna told me to.) I cough and let the cool breeze caress my sweaty chin.

In the midst of the garden is the Virgin Mary. La Morenita is no longer of grace, acid erosion graying her skin, like a skin eating disease, infected by Mother Nature’s processes tainted by man’s productivity. She gazes up at me and I say a prayer in the recesses of my mind, my lips part slightly at “amen”. 

(Her headscarf is no longer blue, peeling and unveiling a luminescent white, as if revealing a new level of ascension, where all of her original self will molt and turn into a  bone licked clean.) Her pupils have worn off, her eyes a blank space but always knowing.  I close the windows, they groan and the click of the latch echoes through the silence. The stuffiness of the room thickens again.

I came here to mourn someone I don’t know. Connected blood, veins filled with a liquid that is cold. Thin. It is foreign to me, yet here I am dusting and cleaning a room that I will only live in for a month.

What makes it worse, this is my aunt’s room. The person that I’m wearing black itchy slacks and listening to funeral organs for. 

Above the bed, with a broken bed frame and box held up with styrofoam blocks, is a cross.

I take it down and place it in the night table drawer, open the windows again, and lay down on the bed.

Luna: “Sleeping already? Had a rough night on the boat? Haven't been on one since I was five.”

I wake up to the sound of my cousin’s voice and feel her weight at foot of the bed as she sits down on it. But my brain hasn’t really processed that she’s a blood relative. She also looks unrelated to the whole Alvarez bloodline, which accentuates this alienness. (Porcelain skin with blue veins coursing through her forearms. Her browns that transition to hazel when the bears its on them. But her hair has a tinge of red that my mother born Black to the bone came to the earth with.) I pull the blankets over myself as if I'm naked beneath them, feeling she’s some stranger that came in uninvited for an open house only they know about. 

Luna: “You weren’t this shy when we were kids.”

I partially unveil my face to my eyes and realize how the blanket smells musty, looks yellowed with sun and stillness, many years of neglect has rendered it stiff with dust. 

Last night, Luna and I had discussed over the dinner table (underneath a flickering lamp as lightning strikes above the island wires) that this house now belongs to me. 

So I spent the night dusting my room to at least make it habitable and then sat on the bed, read articles on my phone, and stared out the window till the sun came up. There is much more to clean in this house. There’s just so much to do. I haven’t even accepted this massive gift yet. 

But it’s a free hotel, I’ve been meaning to leave the city, and this is the house of a Tia that favored me. 

It isn’t big though, it’s quite quaint, but still the concept of actually having my name on it, is more surreal than the time I won an award for a performance art show I interrupted on accident. (I will talk about this later.) 

What really will torment the recesses of my mind though, is the vast amount of land. (After all I was raised with traffic jams and pollutions of all senses.) 

Luna gets up and then pulls a plastic sheet off the vanity across the bed. I sure don’t look friendly. I got dark lunas (Pun not intended) under my eyes and red branches in my sclera reaching across to the pupil. But she's also acting like she met me last Tuesday and not for the first time in a decade.

Luna: "No one told you to leave a whole course meal on the table last night."

She laughs, smacks my foot and gets up from the bed. She turns, squints at something over me for just a moment, noticing the cross is gone from above me, then does this smile that reveals her upper incisors. 

Luna: "I put it in the fridge when you went upstairs. Can't be wasting food cuz you're excited."

Simon: "I wouldn't say excited..."

Luna: "I know it's a lot to think about, Simon, but I'm not saying you're gonna handle it all alone."

I mull over that sentence for a bit, but before I could say anything she talks about getting something from the freezer and leaves the room, closing the door behind her, like it isn't hot enough already.

===dayintroHouse===

Luna had warned me that the house was in disarray before I came. That a month before her mother passed, Luna had come back home from an overseas internship to find her mother sitting at her work desks with towers of packed belongings surrounding her. 

The youngest out of four sisters, my aunt has a row of pictures of herself on one wall above the TV. My mother is the middle sibling. The two eldest have gone to the U.S. and never talked to us again.

All of the boxes surrounding us are filled with pictures and papers that Luna never specifies what exactly the ink holds.
